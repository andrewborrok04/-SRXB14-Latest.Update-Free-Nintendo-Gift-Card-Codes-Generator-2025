About Nintendo eShop
The Nintendo eShop is an integral part of Nintendoâ€™s digital presence, serving as the exclusive online distribution service for their gaming content. Launched in June 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS, the platform was later expanded to serve users of the Wii U and the hugely popular Nintendo Switch. The eShop hosts a wide variety of digital games, ranging from blockbuster releases and indie gems to classic titles from older Nintendo consoles. Beyond games, it also offers downloadable content (DLC) and game demos, allowing players to expand their gaming experience or try new games before buying them.

Available in over 80 countries, the Nintendo eShop makes it easy for gamers around the world to access their favorite games anytime. Unlike traditional retail stores, the eShop is open 24/7, providing a convenient and fast way to get games directly on your device.
